# CSS Fonts

## CSS font-family Property

In CSS, we use the font-family property to specify the font of a text.

## Fallback Fonts

Web safe fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all browsers and devices.

However, there are no 100% completely web safe fonts. There is always a chance that a font is not found or is not installed properly.

Therefore, it is very important to always use fallback fonts.

## Font Style

The font-style property is mostly used to specify italic text.

This property has three values:

- normal - The text is shown normally
- italic - The text is shown in italics
- oblique - The text is "leaning" (oblique is very similar to italic, but less supported)

## Font Weight

The font-weight property specifies the weight of a font.

## Font Size

The font-size property sets the size of the text.

Being able to manage the text size is important in web design. However, you should not use font size adjustments to make paragraphs look like headings, or headings look like paragraphs.

## Google Fonts

If you do not want to use any of the standard fonts in HTML, you can use Google Fonts.

# CSS Text

CSS has a lot of properties for formatting text.

## Text Color

The color property is used to set the color of the text.

## Text Alignment

The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text.

A text can be left or right aligned, centered, or justified.

When the text-align property is set to "justify", each line is stretched so that every line has equal width, and the left and right margins are straight (like in magazines and newspapers).

## Vertical Alignment

The vertical-align property sets the vertical alignment of an element.

## Text Decoration

All links in HTML are underlined by default. Sometimes you see that links are styled with no underline. The `text-decoration: none;` is used to remove the underline from links.

## Text Transformation

The text-transform property is used to specify uppercase and lowercase letters in a text.

It can be used to turn everything into uppercase or lowercase letters, or capitalize the first letter of each word.

## Letter Spacing

The letter-spacing property is used to specify the space between the characters in a text.

## Line Height

The line-height property is used to specify the space between lines.

## Text Shadow

The text-shadow property adds shadow to text.

`text-shadow: horizontal-shadow  vertical-shadow [blur-effect] color;`

## CSS background-color

The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.
