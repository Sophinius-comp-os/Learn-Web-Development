      Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be
      distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
      The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
      distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
      making it look like readable English.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
      as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
      many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
      the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour
      and the like).
