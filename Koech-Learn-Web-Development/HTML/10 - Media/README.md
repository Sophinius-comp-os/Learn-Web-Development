# HTML MEDIA

Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, movies, and animations.

Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see, like images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.

Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats.

### Multimedia Formats

Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files.

The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension.

Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.

## HTML Video

The HTML `<video>` element is used to show a video on a web page.

The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The `<source>` element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the `<video>` and `</video>` tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the `<video>` element.

To start a video automatically, use the autoplay attribute.

## HTML Audio

To play an audio file in HTML, use the `<audio>` element

The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

The `<source>` element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the `<audio>` and `</audio>` tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the `<audio>` element.

To start an audio file automatically, use the autoplay attribute.

Add muted after autoplay to let your audio file start playing automatically (but muted):

### HTML Iframes

An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.

The HTML `<iframe>` tag specifies an inline frame.

An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

### Playing a YouTube Video in HTML

To play your video on a web page, do the following:

- Upload the video to YouTube
- Take a note of the video id
- Define an `<iframe>` element in your web page
- Let the src attribute point to the video URL
- Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player
- Add any other parameters to the URL (see below)
